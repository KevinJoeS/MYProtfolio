## 👤 About Me

I am an Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning student with a strong foundation in Python, SQL, core ML concepts, and Web Interface Development.  
I work with algorithms, data structures, and modern UI principles to build efficient and clean user-focused web applications.

I’ve built projects such as a music streaming platform, contributed to a company portfolio for PixelPlus, and completed a Web Development Internship at Altruisty.  
I enjoy learning, teaching, and consistently improving through practical projects.
